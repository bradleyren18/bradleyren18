Hello, you probably want to know if I am a FAILURE. Well, that's for you to decide.
I guess I just put some achievements and stuff here as this is a bio and you need to decide if I am a FAILURE.

Iâ€™m interested in maths(algebra, geometry, number theory, counting & probability and precalculus) and programming(python, javascript, html & css, c#) and science(physics, rocket science, chemistry, QUANTUM PHYSICS).
Also, I do do UK maths competitions and olympiads.
And I do programming in Python, Web pages and Unity c#
